I come from Anhui, China.
I've ever been studying in NUAA and will go to HIT for further education.
I major in flight control and information engineering, and have great interest in control theory and flight dynamics.
I commonly use MATLAB/Simulink, C/C++/Arduino, Python. Moreover, I sometimes play with C# and Wolfram Mathmatica.
Maybe you can communicate with me via Email 1074178875@qq.com.
Quite looking forward to all your interacting!
